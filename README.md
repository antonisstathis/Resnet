# Resnet

In this repository is the code of my thesis (Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of University of Patras). It is an implementation from scratch of a residual neural network with 34 layers for the inference. This implementation is in C++ with Catapult hls libraries. The final purpose is to produce the VHDL or Verilog via Catapult hls.
